# Labflow Report

Compose the requested report from the task context and verified artifacts.
The skill is format-neutral: use a report adapter or an optional formatter skill
for Typst, LaTeX, DOCX, Markdown, or PDF.

## When to Use

- A lab, practical, calculation work, or course project requires a written report.

## Procedure

1. Read `context/TASK.md`, `context/context.yaml`, and the requirements checklist.
2. Read code and mathematical result summaries, not just filenames.
3. Select the requested report format; if none is specified, use Markdown.
4. Build a requirement-to-evidence matrix before drafting.
5. Write the report in the required section order.
6. Include formulas, code excerpts, tables, and figures only from real artifacts.
7. Add a short limitations section when inputs or checks are incomplete.
8. Save the source under `report/` and compile/render it when the format supports compilation.

## Rules

- The report describes completed work; it must not become a second solver.
- Never invent outputs, screenshots, citations, or passed checks.
- Keep raw source code and raw data outside the report unless explicitly requested.
- Do not assume a title-page format, university, GOST, or fixed Typst template.
- Preserve the provenance of every important numerical claim.

## Output Contract

```text
report/<report-source>          # format chosen by the project
report/requirements-matrix.md
```

A compiled artifact such as `report/report.pdf` is required only when the
task explicitly requests it or the selected adapter supports it.

## Self-Review Handoff

Check that every required section exists, every referenced file exists, and each
important result points to a saved artifact or execution log. Hand off to
`labflow-self-review` instead of declaring success yourself.
